# Star_System

An interactive star system build in [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), a ReactJS framework. This is a remake of a [previous repository](https://github.com/AmnonSkladman/reachForTheStars).

# Purpose

This is honestly mostly a personal project for myself. It's a good way to keep practicing ReactJS in the NextJS platform while also doing some CSS styling. However, it's also a web application that others will hopefully someday get to enjoy. It's meant to educate people regardless of age or background about our solar system. I love space and have been fascinated in it for a long time, so this is a way for me to share my love for space.

# Road Map

Right now, I am working on adding all the planets to the solar system and implement relatively accurate orbital speeds and planet sizing. After that, I am going to work on adding onClick events that would show pop-ups with useful information on the planets. Not really sure what else I'm going to add yet. If you have any ideas, please let me know!
