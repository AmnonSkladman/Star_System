    <h1>Reach For The Stars</h1>
    <h2>The Interactive Solar System</h2>
    <p>
      This project started out as a side project for me to work on during my
      spare time. I absolutely love space and anything space-related. I alsos
      love sci-fi, but I digress. One of my main goals for this project is to
      turn it into a fun and education tool for everyone, regardless of age,
      gender, race, etc. I want to help everyone get educated on space, because
      it's super fascinating, and it'll hopefully help us understand the world
      we live in. After all, we're now in a new age where space travel is
      becoming crucial.

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, my immediate plans are to add all planets, including the dwarf
      ones, as well as all the moons. I also want to add the asteroid belt and
      other similar stellar bodies and groups. Eventually, I'm hoping to add
      everything between Sol and the Oort Cloud, though that feels a little too
      ambitious at the moment.
